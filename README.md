# SX1272 LoRa/LoRaWAN API for STM32F4xx
This is a project for the 2018-19 Summer Research Program at The University of Queensland. The aim of the research is to design and prototype a Communication Interface using Internet of Things (IoT) and a Stand-alone Power Supply for Transformer Monitoring Systems. Source codes can be found under Firmware directory and product schematics can be found under Hardware directory.

The initial design consists of 2 LoRa transmitters and a LoRa receiver node. Each node uses a STM32F446RE Nucleo development board and a SX1272MB2DAS shield (which has a SX1272 LoRa Transceiver IC from Semtech). The STM32F4 HAL drivers and hardware configurations are generated by STM32CubeMX. Datasheets for these modules can be found under Documentations directory.

Further versions of the project will be using a LoRa gateway to create a P2P network. 

Please note that this project started on 19/11/18 and is still in development. Thus, full funtionality of the API have not yet been achieved. Stay tuned ;)
