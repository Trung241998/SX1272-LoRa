# SX1272 LoRa/LoRaWAN API for STM32F4xx
This is a project for the 2018-19 Summer Research Program at The University of Queensland. The aim of the research is to design and prototype a Communication Interface using Internet of Things (IoT) and a Stand-alone Power Supply for Transformer Monitoring System. Source code can be found under Firmware directory and product schematics can be found under Hardware directory.

Initial design consists of a LoRa transmiter and a LoRa receiver node. Each node uses a STM32F446RE Nucleo development board and a SX1272MB2DAS shield (which has a SX1272 LoRa Transceiver IC from Semtech). Datasheets for these modules can be found under Documentation directory.
