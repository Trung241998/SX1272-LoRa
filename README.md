# SX1272 LoRa/LoRaWAN API for STM32F4xx
This is a project for the 2018-19 Summer Research Program at The University of Queensland. The aim of the research is to design and prototype a Communication Interface using Internet of Things (IoT) and a Stand-alone Power Supply for Transformer Monitoring Systems. Source codes can be found under Firmware directory and product schematics can be found under Hardware directory.

The initial design consists of a LoRa transmiter and a LoRa receiver node. Each node uses a STM32F446RE Nucleo development board and a SX1272MB2DAS shield (which has a SX1272 LoRa Transceiver IC from Semtech). Datasheets for these modules can be found under Documentation directory.

Further versions of the project will be using a LoRa gateway to create a P2P network. 

Please note that this project started on 19/11/18 and is still in development. Thus, full funtionality of the API have not yet been achieved. Stay tuned ;)
